# Normal Flow Prediction
This project consists of a deep learning model able to predict the normal flow between two consecutive frames, being the normal flow the projection of the optical flow on the gradient directions. The datset used to train the model has been [TartanAir dataset](https://theairlab.org/tartanair-dataset/)
