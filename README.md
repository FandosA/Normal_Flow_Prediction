# Normal Flow Prediction
This project consists of a deep learning model able to predict the normal flow between two consecutive frames, being the normal flow the projection of the optical flow on the gradient directions. The dataset used to train the model has been [TartanAir dataset](https://theairlab.org/tartanair-dataset/) and the deep learning model is an encoder-decoder with residual blocks based on [EVPropNet](https://prg.cs.umd.edu/EVPropNet).
